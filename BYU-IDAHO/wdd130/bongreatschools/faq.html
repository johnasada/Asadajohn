                    <p>
                        The most effective way to plan for registration is to make sure you have the following documents with you:
                        Birth Certificate, Past session transcript or transfer letter from previous school, Complete school fees. Other financial adustments will be discussed in person.

                    <h2> What is so Great about BONGREAT school ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. 
                        Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. 
                        Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare 
                        for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, 
                        and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company 
                        by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies... 
                        you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story 
                        or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.

                        We start recieving applications twice a year one in April another in September.
