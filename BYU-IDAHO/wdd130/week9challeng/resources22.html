                Computer Resources
            </h2>
            <p>
                In computing, a system resource, or simple resource, is any physical 
                or virtual component of limited availability within a computer system. 
                All connected devices and internal system components are resources. 
                Virtual system resources include files (concretely file handles), 
                network connections (concretely network sockets), and memory areas.
                Managing resources is referred to as resource management, and 
                includes both preventing resource leaks (not releasing a resource 
                when a process has finished using it) and dealing with resource contention 
                (when multiple processes wish to access a limited resource). Computing resources 
                are used in cloud computing to provide services through networks.
            <p>
                One can also distinguish compressible resources from incompressible resources. 
                Compressible resources, generally throughput ones such as CPU and network bandwidth, 
                can be throttled benignly: the user will be slowed proportionally to the throttling, 
                but will otherwise proceed normally. Other resources, generally storage ones such as 
                memory, cannot be throttled without either causing failure (if a process cannot allocate 
                enough memory, it typically cannot run) or severe performance degradation, such as due to 
                thrashing (if a working set does not fit into memory and requires frequent paging, progress
                will slow significantly).
