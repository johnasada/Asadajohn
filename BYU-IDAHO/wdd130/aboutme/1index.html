    <h2>My nickname is Slim</h2>
    <p>My name is John Asada I am from Nigeria a student of BYU Idaho I am running a degree in applied technology,
        with this i want to to be more of a web developer thats why i love the course. My hobbies are dancing,
        i also love singing and watching movies i love sports as well i love to play any thing sport or even learn new ones.
        I am 24 years old and i am single with no kids, I am not working but i'm searching for a job that will give me time 
        for my studies. One thing i love about BYU idaho is that it gives me enough time to do other things while i'm pursuing
        an education, like i said i love the degree im pursuing is because it will help me archive my dreams of becoming a 
        computer programmer and web developer.</p>

        my favorite quote is that of President Nelson when he said we should Know God and how he works.</p>
