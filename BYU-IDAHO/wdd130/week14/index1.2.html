                        System maintenance is an umbrella term that encompasses various forms of 
                        computer maintenance needed to keep a system running. The two main components
                        of system maintenance are preventive and corrective maintenance. 
                        Preventive maintenance involves taking measures to help keep the system 
                        functioning, whereas corrective maintenance involves the replacement 
                        or repair of a system or its components after they have already failed.
